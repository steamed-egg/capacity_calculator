## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x (for local server)
- Node.js (for testing, optional)

### Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/capacity-forecast-chatbot.git
cd capacity-forecast-chatbot
```

Start the application:
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080

```
http://localhost:8080
```

## Usage

### Basic Conversation

Start with any capacity-related question:

```
"What's my capacity for October 2025 with 25 team members?"
```

The bot will guide you through collecting:
- **Time Window**: When you want the forecast for
- **Staff Count**: Number of team members
- **Average Implementation Time**: Hours per task
- **Availability Ratio**: Percentage of productive time (e.g., 85%)

### Example Workflow

| Step | User Input | Bot Response |
|------|------------|--------------|
| 1 | "What's my capacity for next month?" | "How many staff members are on your team?" |
| 2 | "15" | "What's the average implementation time per task?" |
| 3 | "3 hours" | "What's your expected availability ratio?" |
| 4 | "85%" | *Displays interactive dashboard* |

### Dashboard Features

The result displays as a comprehensive dashboard with:

- **4-Column Metrics**: Team Members, Working Days, Availability, Available Hours
- **Work Type Breakdown**: New Implementation (65%) vs Update Requests (35%)
- **Calculation Details**: Step-by-step math with professional alignment
- **Action Buttons**: Reset calculations and download PDF reports

## Available Scripts

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `python3 -m http.server 8080` | Start development server |
| `npm test` | Run Playwright tests |
| `npm run test:headed` | Run tests with visible browser |
| `npm run test:ui` | Interactive test interface |
| `npx playwright test tests/screenshots.spec.js` | Generate documentation screenshots |

## Testing

The app includes comprehensive end-to-end testing:

```bash
# Install test dependencies

## Calculation Formula

The system allocates capacity between two work types:

```
Available Hours = [Working Days √ó 8 hours √ó Staff Count] √ó Availability Ratio

New Implementation Hours = Available Hours √ó 65%
Update Request Hours = Available Hours √ó 35%

New Implementation Tasks = New Implementation Hours √∑ Avg Implementation Time
```

Where working days exclude weekends (Monday-Friday only).
