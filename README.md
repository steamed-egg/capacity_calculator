## Required Inputs

1. **Time Window**: When you want the forecast for
2. **Staff Count**: Number of team members
3. **Average New Implementation Time**: Hours per new implementation task
4. **Availability Ratio**: Percentage of time available for work (e.g., 80% accounts for meetings, breaks, etc.)

## Calculation Formula

The system allocates capacity between two work types:
- **New Implementation**: 65% of available hours (calculated as task count)
- **Update Request**: 35% of available hours (tracked as allocated hours)

```
Available Hours = [Working days √ó 8 hours √ó Staff count] √ó Availability ratio
New Implementation Hours = Available Hours √ó 65%
Update Request Hours = Available Hours √ó 35%

New Implementation Tasks = New Implementation Hours √∑ Avg New Implementation Time
Update Request Hours = Available for flexible update work (not converted to task count)
```

Where working days = Monday through Friday (weekends excluded)
